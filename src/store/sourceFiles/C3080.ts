PF-707m (2nd tandem): Paper feed assist fan abnormality 
Cause 
An error detection signal is detected continuously for a specified period of time while the paper feed assist fan/Rr2 (FM16) is active. 
An error detection signal is detected continuously while you retry power feed several times. 
Measures to take when an alert occurs

PF-707m (3rd tandem): Paper feed assist fan abnormality 
Cause 
An error detection signal is detected continuously for a specified period of time while the paper feed assist fan/Rr3 (FM20) is active. 
An error detection signal is detected continuously while you retry power feed several times. 
Measures to take when an alert occurs 
The main body and the option stop immediately. 
Estimated abnormal parts 
  •  PFU drive board (PFUDB) 
  •  Paper feed assist fan/Rr3 (FM20) 
Correction 
Note  
  ▪  The message "Please call service" is displayed on the panel. 
Solution 
  1. Execute the IO Check (29-91) of the paper feed assist fan/Fr3 (FM19) and the paper feed assist fan/Rr3 (FM20) (Tray 11) (PF 3rd tandem). 
  2. When the result of the IO Check in step 1 is normal, FM20 is not abnormal. Go on to step 4. 
     For details of IO check results, refer to "Table 1: Result check." 
  3. Check the connector connections between PFUDB and FM20, CN117 of the PFUDB, CN355 of the FM20, CN350 (tray 9 drawer), CN380 
     (side guide), and the wiring. Then repair it when there is any abnormality. 
  4. Rotate FM20 by hand, and repair it when there is any abnormality. 
  5. Replace FM20. 
  6. Replace PFUDB.

Solution 
  1. Execute the IO Check (42-73) of the paper feed assist fan/RtFr (FM3). 
  2. When the result of the IO Check in step 1 is normal, FM3 is not abnormal. Go on to step 4. 
     For details of IO check results, refer to "Table 1: Result check." 
  3. Check the connector connections between LUDB and FM3, CN9 of the LUDB, CN850 (relay connector), CN851 (relay connector), CN852 
     (relay connector), CN744 of the FM3, and the wiring. Then repair it when there is any abnormality. 
  4. Rotate FM3 by hand, and repair it when there is any abnormality. 
  5. Replace FM3.

within a specified period of time. Alternatively, during the clamp release operation, the PS31 does not become active within a specified period of 
time after the M23 starts the operation. 
When M23 starts operation, the clamp motor encoder sensor (PS121) does not become active. 
Measures to take when an alert occurs 
The main body and the option stop immediately. 
Estimated abnormal parts 
  •  Clamp open close home sensor (PS31) 
  •  Clamp motor encoder sensor (PS121)

SD: SD-513 abnormality 
Cause 
The trimmer press motor (M32) starts to operate and a specified period of time has passed. However, the press complete signal (the over 
current detection of the M32) does not become active. 
You conduct the output check of the I/O check mode (the M32 trimmer board attachment sequence) after the replacement of the trimmer board. 
Then, a specified period of time has passed. However, the trimmer press upper limit sensor (PS51) and the trimmer press home sensor (PS52) 
does not become active. 
Measures to take when an alert occurs 
The main body and the option stop immediately. 
Estimated abnormal parts 
  •  Trimmer press upper limit sensor (PS51) 
  •  Trimmer press home sensor (PS52) 
  •  Trimmer press motor (M32) 
  •  SD drive board (PCB2) 
  •  SD control board (PCB1) 
Correction 
Press the help key to activate and deactivate the sub power switch (SW2) of the main body.

  ▪  When you isolate the faulty part, the limited use is available. 
  ▪  The message "Please call service" and "Press [Help] to disengage" are displayed alternately on the touch panel. 
  ▪  When you press the help key, the message "Please turn on power again" is displayed on the touch panel. 
Solution 
  1. Check the trimmer press drive section, and if there is any abnormality, clean or repair it. 
  2. Check the connector connection and the wiring harness between PCB2 and M32, PCB1 and PS51, PS52. Then, repair them when there is

Main body: Fusing temperature sensor/3 wiring disconnection abnormality 
Cause 
The fusing unit becomes inactive because the door opens or closes when the machine starts warm-up or it is in the low power mode. Then, the 
AD value of the fusing temperature sensor/3 (TH3) changes abnormally within the specified period of time after the fusing unit becomes active 
again, and the wiring disconnection is detected. 
Measures to take when an alert occurs 
The main body and the option stop immediately to deactivate the main relay.

Main body: Fusing temperature sensor/4 abnormality 
Cause 
Within a specified period of time after the warm-up starts, the temperature that the fusing temperature sensor/4 (TH4) detects does not reach 40 
°C However, the detection is not performed in the monochrome energy-save mode. 
In the other case, it has not satisfied the Ready condition of TH4 within a specified period of time after the warm-up starts. 
Measures to take when an alert occurs 
The main body and the option stop immediately to deactivate the main relay.

Main body: Color registration sensor/Rr (C) abnormality 
Cause 
The histogram processing of the C toner has terminated abnormally in the color registration sensor/Rr (PS62). 
Measures to take when an alert occurs 
The main body and the option stop immediately to deactivate the main relay. 
Estimated abnormal parts 
  •  Printer control board 
  •  Color registration sensor/Rr (PS62) 
  •  Color registration shutter solenoid (SD4) 
  •  Intermediate transfer belt 
Correction 
Note  
  ▪  The message "Please call service" is displayed on the panel. 
Solution 
  1. Output the test pattern. Check whether the uneven density occurs on the C toner area. 
  2. Check the intermediate transfer belt, and clean or replace it when there is toner image or damage. 
  3. Check the connector connection and the wiring between PRCB and PS62, SD4, and repair it when there is any abnormality. 
  4. Perform a visual check and IO Check (36-04) of the PS62, and IO Check (55-00) of the SD4. Then repair or replace it when there is any 
     abnormality.

Main body: Image processing 
Cause 
Within a specified period of time after the negation of SVV, the compression of images that are read in and their development into the page 
memory are not terminated. 
Measures to take when an alert occurs 
The main body and the option stop immediately to deactivate the main relay. 
Estimated abnormal parts 
  •  Printer image processing board (PRIPB) 
  •  Scanner image processing board (SCIPB)
