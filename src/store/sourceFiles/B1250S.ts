Cause 
       PI-PFU (PF-703) lower tray up abnormality. 
      When the upper limit sensor /3 (PS13) is OFF, PS13 does not turn ON within 20 seconds after the paper lift motor /3 (M9) turns ON for 
       lifting operation. Or, the paper suction sensor /Fr3 and /Rr3 (PS29 and PS30) turn ON before PS13 turns ON while in tray lifting. 
Measures to take when alert occurs 
      The main body and the option stop immediately. 
Estimated abnormal parts 
        •  Upper limit sensor /3 (PS13: PF-703)

Cause 
       PI-PFU (PF-703) paper suction fan /5 (FM18) rotation abnormality. 
      The FM18EM error detection signal is detected twice in succession within a specified period of time after FM18 was turned ON. However, 
      an error detection signal (blowout of ICP) is not detected. 
Measures to take when alert occurs 
      The main body and the option stop immediately. 
Estimated abnormal parts 
        •  Paper suction fan /6 (FM18: PF-703) 
        •  PF drive board (PFUDB: PF-703) 
Correction 
      Turn OFF/ON the power switch (SW2) of the main body when releasing an abnormal condition. 
       Note

Classification 
      SD: SD-513/FD-504 abnormality 
Cause 
      After the FD clamp motor/Rr (M202) starts the home position search operation, the FD clamp pressure release home sensor/Rr (PS201) 
      does not become active within a specified period of time. Alternatively, after the FD clamp motor/Fr (M203) starts the home position search 
      operation, the FD clamp pressure release home sensor/Fr (PS205) does not become active within a specified period of time. 
      The FD clamp open close sensor/Rr (PS202) does not become active even after a specified period of time after M202 starts the operation. 
      Alternatively, the FD clamp open close sensor/Fr (PS206) does not become active even after a specified period of time after M203 starts 
      the operation. 
      At the start, the activation of the PS201 and the PS202 are detected at the same time. 
      At the start, the activation of the PS205 and the PS206 are detected at the same time. 
Measures to take when alert occurs 
      The main body and the option stop immediately.
