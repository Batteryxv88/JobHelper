Solution 
  1. Execute the IO Check (26-22) of the loop motor/2 (M6) (PF 2nd tandem: 985 mm/s). 
  2. When the result of the IO Check in the step 1 is normal, M6 is not abnormal. Go on to step 4. 
     For details of IO check results, refer to "Table 1: Result check." 
  3. Check the connector connection between PFUDB and M6, CN155 of PFUDB, CN370 of M6, CN350 (tray 6 drawer), CN385 (near the

PF-707m (3rd tandem): Paper feed assist fan abnormality 
Cause 
An error detection signal is detected continuously for a specified period of time while the paper feed assist fan/Fr3 (FM19) is active. 
An error detection signal is detected continuously while you retry power feed several times. 
Measures to take when an alert occurs 
The main body and the option stop immediately.

Note  
  ▪  The message "Please call service" is displayed on the panel. 
Solution 
  1. Execute the IO Check (29-91) of the paper feed assist fan/Fr3 (FM19) and the paper feed assist fan/Rr3 (FM20) (Tray 11) (PF 3rd tandem). 
  2. When the result of the IO Check in step 1 is normal, FM19 is not abnormal. Go on to step 4. 
     For details of IO check results, refer to "Table 1: Result check." 
  3. Check the connector connections between PFUDB and FM19, CN117 of the PFUDB, CN354 of the FM19, CN350 (tray 9 drawer), CN375

Solution 
  1. Execute the IO Check (43-15) of the PFU drive board (PFUDB). 
  2. When the result of the IO Check in the step 1 is normal, PFUDB is not abnormal. Go on to step 4. 
     For details of IO check results, refer to "Table 1: Result check." 
  3. Check CN100 of PFUDB, CN201 (PFU 2nd tandem of the PFU 3rd tandem side relay), CN201 (PFU 1st tandem of PFU 2nd tandem side 
     relay), CN201 (the main body of PFU 1st tandem side relay), CN203 (PFU 2nd tandem and PFU 3rd tandem of PFU 1st tandem side and 
     PFU 2nd tandem side relay), CN496 (near the PFU relay part of the main body side), CN11 of the DC power supply unit/1 (DCPS/1), and 
     the wiring. Then repair it when there is any abnormality. 
  4. Replace PFUDB.

Note  
  ▪  The message "Please call service" is displayed on the panel. 
Solution 
  1. If any of the front doors had opened during the image diagnosis, close all the front doors, and conduct the image diagnosis again. 
  2. Execute [Service Mode] - [Machine Adjustment] - [Printer Adjustment] - [Color Registration Auto. Adj.]. 
  3. If an error occurs, resolve it according to the error type. ( I.4.3.11 Color Registration Auto.Adj. (Printer Adjustment)) 
  4. When you retry the image diagnosis and the error is detected again, store the log in either of the following measures. 
      · [Service] - [Log Store] - [Execute Log Storing] - [Log+IQ Image Manual Store] 
      · [UTILITY] - [System Information] - [Store Log & IQ Image] 
  5. Report it with that log to KMBT. 
Note  
  ▪  Do not deactivate and activate the main power until you acquire the log data.

IQ-501: Scanner input DMA abnormality (scanner unit/1) 
Cause 
An abnormality is detected during the operation of the scanner input DMA. 
Measures to take when an alert occurs 
The main body and the option stop immediately. 
Estimated abnormal parts 
  •  I/F cable/3 (AAANN270) 
  •  MicroSD card (μSDC) 
  •  VI control board (VICB) 
  •  VIF board (VIFB) 
Correction 
Deactivate and activate the sub power switch (SW2) of the main body. 
Or press the help key, and isolate the faulty part. 
Note  
  ▪  The message "Please turn on power again" is displayed on the touch panel. 
  ▪  When you isolate the faulty part, the limited use is available. The message "Please call service" and "Press [Help] to disengage" 
     are displayed alternately on the touch panel. 
Solution 
  1. Prior check 
       •  Check the connector and the wiring of VIFB. 
       •  Check the wiring of the scanner unit/1. 
  2. Check the connector connection between VIFB and the IQ relay board (PCB6), CN501 of VIFB, CN103 of PCB6, and the wiring. Then 
     repair it when there is any abnormality. 
  3. Replace the I/F cable/3. 
  4. Replace μSDC. 
     Note 
       ▪  After you replace μSDC, reinstall the VI-514 firmware (ISW target: Q3).
