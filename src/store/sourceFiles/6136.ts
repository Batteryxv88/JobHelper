PF-710 (2nd tandem): Power source abnormality 
Cause 
Power source abnormality for the vertical conveyance motor/Lw (M14) in the PF drive board (PFUDB) of the PF-710 2nd tandem. 
When the printing starts, the error detection signal (blowout of ICP) of M14 is detected. At this time, a close signal of the door is detected 10 
times in succession within a specified period of time. 
Measures to take when an alert occurs 
The main body and the option stop immediately. 
Estimated abnormal parts 
  •  Vertical conveyance motor/Lw (M14: PF-710) 
  •  PF drive board (PFUDB: PF-710) 
Correction 
Press the help key to activate and deactivate the sub power switch (SW2) of the main body. 
Note  
  ▪  When you isolate the faulty part, the limited use is available. 
  ▪  The message "Please call service" and "Press [Help] to disengage" are displayed alternately on the touch panel. 
  ▪  When you press the help key, the message "Please turn on power again" is displayed on the touch panel. 
Solution 
  1. Check the connector connection between PFUDB and M14, and the wiring. Then repair it when there is any abnormality. 
  2. Check the IO Check (26-32) of M14 and the coupling of the gear, and repair or replace it when there is any abnormality. (Wiring diagram:

PI-PFU: Tray 3 
Cause 
PI-PFU (PF-710) shutter motor/3 (M6) operation time abnormality 1. 
Within a specified period of time after the M6 becomes active, the error detection signal is detected twice in succession. At this time, the error 
detection (the motor and sensor ICP blowout) signal is not detected. 
Measures to take when an alert occurs 
The main body and the option stop immediately. 
Estimated abnormal parts 
  •  Shutter motor/3 (M6: PF-710) 
  •  Shutter home sensor/3 (PS39: PF-710) 
  •  PF drive board (PFUDB: PF-710) 
Correction 
Press the help key to activate and deactivate the sub power switch (SW2) of the main body.

Main body: Fan abnormality 
Cause 
Rotation abnormality for the paper feed assist fan/Fr1 (FM21) + Power source abnormality for the 24 V. Within a specified period of time after 
FM21 becomes active, the error detection signal of FM is detected twice in succession. At this time, an error detection signal (24 V cut off) is not 
detected. 
Measures to take when an alert occurs 
The main body and the option stop immediately. 
Estimated abnormal parts 
  •  Paper feed assist fan/Fr1 (FM21) 
  •  Printer control board (PRCB) 
Correction 
Press the help key to activate and deactivate the sub power switch (SW2) of the main body. 
Note  
  ▪  When you isolate the faulty part, the limited use is available.  
  ▪  The message "Please call service" and "Press [Help] to disengage" are displayed alternately on the touch panel.  
  ▪  When you press the help key, the message "Please turn on power again" is displayed on the touch panel.  
Solution 
  1. Check the connector connection between PRCB and FM21, and the wiring. Then repair it when there is any abnormality. 
  2. Rotate FM21 with the IO Check (10-66) or by hand. Then repair or replace it when there is any abnormality. (Wiring diagram: Main body

Classification 
RU-518: RU-518 abnormality (1st device) 
Cause 
When the horizontal conveyance pipe cooling fan/2Rr (FM15) is active, an error detection signal is detected continuously for a specified period 
of time. Though the machine retries power feed several times, an error detection signal is detected continuously. 
Measures to take when an alert occurs
